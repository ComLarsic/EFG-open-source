## What is EFG?
on 2016 user sparta posted about this game on r/tipofmyjoystick, asking if anyone knows the name of the game. no one has ever found this game, despite the large amount of people who search for this game.
EFG is a farming game similar to harvest moon and stardew valley but with a dark twist. At the start of the game, you stab your wife to death and now you have to hide the body from the police and the townsfolk, while managing your farm to survive.

## What is EFG Open Source?
There has been several attempts to remake this game, most of them were abandoned or failed due to various reasons. This project is another attempt, but the source is publicly accessable and everyone are welcome to contribute.

## What engine are you using? What language?
We are using Godot. If you want to commit to the master branch we ask you to use either GDscript or C#.

## Can I help you with this project? What do you need?
Of course! Any kind of help is welcome. including:
- programmers
- 2D artists
- Designers
- Composers 

Even small ideas might be valueable to the team. consider joining our [discord](https://discord.gg/gYeNEDv) for more information.

## How can I run this source on my computer?
You will need Godot mono since a large amount of this project is written in C#. Check [this](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html), it is an official godot doc about how to setup godot mono.
If you plan to use MSbuild to run the project, you will need to have .net Framework 4.7 developer pack  installed, or you can change the target version by editing the EvilFarmingGame.csproj file.
